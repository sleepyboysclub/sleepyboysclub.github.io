On October 2nd, 2023, the Sleepy Boys Club will gather for a monthly meetup, focused on the topic of Momento Mori. 

For our activity, we will be writing our own eulogies, following the format outlined in an [Attuned Psychology article](https://attunedpsychology.com/writing-eulogy-help-live-life-want-right-now/).

We will consider and write our thoughts about the life we would like to live, the life we would not like to live, and some ways that we could align our efforts more closely to our values.
