Tonight the Sleepy Boys Club met to do a bit of inner child work. What is inner child work? Hell if any of us arm chair philosophers, self helpers, and/or friendos know! We brought our favorite childhood arts and crafts supplies and treats and snacked and arted to our inner child’s heart’s content!
