title: Own the Day: A Book Club Discussion
categories: future-meetups
---

On November 6th, the Sleepy Boys Club will meet for a group discussion about healthy daily habits. The discussion will focus on Aubrey Marcus’s book, “Own the Day, Own Your Life.”

“Own the Day, Own Your Life” is a book that outlines the perfect day. It covers a wide range of practices that contribute to feeling good today and lead to long-term wellbeing. The book’s subtitle is “Optimized Practices for Waking, Working, Learning, Eating, Training, Playing, Sleeping, and Sex,” indicating the broad range of topics the book covers to help readers have their best day. 

Our discussion will focus primarily on the first chapter of the book, which outlines the optimal morning routine. However, the discussion will be open, allowing participants to talk about their experience with any of the topics covered in the book. We hope to hear thoughts, experiences, and opinions about the successes and struggles with practices from the book as well as those not covered in the book that contribute to having the perfect day.
