The Sleepy Bois Club is a social club and online community for individuals who seek to connect with self and other via the optimistic exploration of philosophy, the post-covid revival of sincerity in physical and digital third places, and the mindful practice of enjoying existence--all things considered.

The modern promulgation of toxic ideologies and figures in media--particularly on the internet--makes manifest the need for positive attitudes,  discussion, resources, and practices in the spaces surrounding mental health, social ideology, community, and general personal well-being. 

The mission of the Sleepy Bois Club is to fill the void of wholesome content left by loud, bad-faith actors whose motivations are primarily fulfilled by hatemongering and othering, pointlessly increasing individuals' anxiety and dissatisfaction with the state of the world. Like many others, the Sleepy Bois believe that the world could be a better place, and we are working (one meetup, post, and meme at a time) to make it better for our members, community, and those who happen upon our group on the web.

Though the name of the Sleepy Bois Club may sound like it's only for "boys," we firmly believe that our sardonic use of "bois" is, in fact, genderless. The Sleepy Bois Club was established for _all_--regardless of sex, gender, or any background whatsoever--who seek a community, support, and friendship without the bullsh*t.
